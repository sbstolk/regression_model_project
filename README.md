#Executive Summary

#Exploratory Analysis
The first step was to load the data an examine the variables. 
```r
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
mtcars[1:3, ]
```
Once the variables were identified, I did some exploratory analysis on each one in turn. The resulting plots are available as Figures [number-number] in Appendix 1.
