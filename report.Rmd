*Executive Summary*
*Exploratory Analysis*
```r
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```r
The next step was doing some basic exploratory analysis on the data. The boxplots are available as Figures [number-number] in Appendix 1. 
```r
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
attach(mtcars)
```r
